## Summer 2023 Tech Internships for Palestinian Students.

When I was a bachelor's student (2009-2014). I realized how hard to get tech internships in our country, back then the remote option was not known and the travel option was not popular. In 2023 getting an internship is still hard because of the low capacity inside the companies compared to the high number of students. 

based on my experience when mentoring Palestinian students. Following are some suggestions/strategies/open opportunities that students can consider to get the tech internship to align with their goals.

 I will name this internship strategy theme ->
